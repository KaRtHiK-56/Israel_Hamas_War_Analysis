# Israel vs Hamas War Analysis

Hi!!! Lads, Welcome to this repository.This is a data analysis project that covers some basic data analysis and observations on the current ongoing conflict between israel vs hamas.

Background:
Britain took control of Palestine after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War One. Palestine was home to both Jewish minority and Arab majority populations. Growing Tensions:

Tensions rose due to the international community's plan for a Jewish "national home" in Palestine. Jewish immigrants increased in the 1920s-1940s, especially after the Holocaust. Violence escalated between Jews, Arabs, and against British rule.

UN Partition Plan:
In 1947, the UN voted for separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine, with Jerusalem as an international city. Jewish leaders accepted the plan, but Arabs rejected it, leading to its non-implementation. Creation of Israel and Conflict:

In 1948, British rulers left, and Israel was declared. Palestinians objected, leading to war and Arab invasion. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced, known as Al Nakba or the "Catastrophe."

Post-1948 Developments:
Israel occupied East Jerusalem, West Bank, Golan Heights, Gaza, and Sinai Peninsula. Palestinian refugees settled in Gaza, West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Israel established settlements in disputed areas, leading to international controversy.
Current Situation:
Tensions persist between Israel and Palestinians in East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank. Gaza is controlled by Hamas; borders tightly controlled by Israel and Egypt. Palestinians face restrictions; Israel cites self-defense, leading to ongoing conflict and disputes over land and resources.
